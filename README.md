# Simple C# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Description

This Rock, Paper, Scissors project aims to create a simple console-based game that allows users to play against the computer. The game will prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and then randomly generate a choice for the computer. After both choices are made, the game will determine the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors. First to reach 3 points wins!

In the future, I am going to integrate unit testing to ensure code reliability and maintainability, as well as expand the game with additional options or variants.
